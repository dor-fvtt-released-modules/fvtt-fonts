# Ideas:

-   Toggle(s) to auto-include pack(s) of themed fonts (fantasy, sci-fi, etc) from Google Fonts
-   Include free font file(s)?
-   User font directory?

## To Do:

-   Account for Polyglot
-   Account for Forien's Custom Fonts
-   Account for FVTT Better Text Drawings
-   Account for things modifying TinyMCE like TinyMCE toolbar config
-   Try for compat with popular journal modules (Mon's Enhanced Journal)
-   Add game system fonts for popular systems (https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/mo2onb/text_fonts_used_in_the_books/)
-   Handle adding duplicates (within and across categories)
-   Move fonts on ManageFonts into sections
-   Move code out of fvtt-fonts class into add-fonts controller
-   Finish wiring up Add Fonts
-   Build install/uninstall workflow
-   Polish manage fonts UI, change opening location
