# Ideas:

-   User font directory?

## To Do:

-   Account for Polyglot
-   Account for Forien's Custom Fonts
-   Account for FVTT Better Text Drawings
-   Account for things modifying TinyMCE like TinyMCE toolbar config
-   Try for compat with popular journal modules (Mon's Enhanced Journal)
-   Add game system fonts for popular systems (https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/mo2onb/text_fonts_used_in_the_books/)
-   Finish local font implementation
-   Finish API
-   Set all font %s and use them
-   Test with popular UI mods
-   Link from manager to previewer
-   Hook up restore defaults
-   CSS polish. Move inline styles to stylesheets
-   Clean up all the warnings/TODOs
-   Clean up locfile & do translations using foundry magic l10n
-   Write README (with bling) and CHANGELOG
-   Comment code as much as possible
